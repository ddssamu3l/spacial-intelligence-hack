// orbit does not.
//
// The harness used to own a `ChaseCamera` of its own: a rigid orbit that sat at
// an azimuth/elevation around the pelvis and snapped there instantly. That was
// fine for a recorded mp4 and read as a tripod when you were driving, and it
// was deleted with the 2-D page. This is the game version -- a spring arm that
// lags, frames the robot off-centre, gets out of the way of the mountain, leans
// into the slope, looks where the robot is going, and drifts back behind it
// when you stop steering. It is now the only chase camera there is.
//
// IT STILL SPEAKS THE SERVER'S LANGUAGE. `azimuthDegrees` / `elevationDegrees`
// are in exactly MuJoCo's convention (azimuth is where the camera SITS,
// elevation is negative when it is above looking down) and go up the socket
// unchanged. The harness reads the AZIMUTH -- that is the steering input, so
// the robot turns toward wherever this camera is looking; it ignores the
// elevation, having no render of its own left to aim.
//
//   offset from the pelvis = distance * (cos(el)cos(az), cos(el)sin(az), -sin(el))
//
// which puts azimuth 180 / elevation -15 behind the robot and slightly above,
// looking uphill along +x, the same default the 2-D page opens on.
