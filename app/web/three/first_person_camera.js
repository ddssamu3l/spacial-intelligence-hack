// The first-person camera: the view from the robot's own eyes -- or, with the
// guide switched on, from the HIKER's (user's ruling, 2026-08-30).
//
// ONE CLASS, TWO SUBJECTS. Both bodies it can ride use the SAME frame
// convention -- x forward, y left, z up -- so the torso-to-camera basis below is
// the whole of what they have in common and the only per-subject numbers are the
// mount offset and the look limits. `stage.js` builds one instance per subject
// and swaps which one it drives; nothing here knows which is which.
//
// WHERE IT SITS. Exactly where the robot's stereo pair sits. `app/harness/
// guide.py::_add_eye_cameras` mounts `eye_left` / `eye_right` either side of the
// `d435i` camera already in `assets/robots/mujoco/g1_unitree_ascender.xml`,
// displaced +/- baseline/2 along the CAMERA's own x axis -- so the midpoint of
// the two eyes IS the d435i mount, and that is the one number this file needs:
//
//     <camera name="d435i" pos="0.0789635 0 0.386" xyaxes="0 -1 0  0 0 1"
//             fovy="58" />                       ... on body `torso_link`
//
// The G1 has no neck. The d435i hangs off `torso_link`, so the eyes turn with
// the waist and rock with the walk for free: this camera is welded to the
// torso body's pose off the wire (app/harness/pose_stream.py), with no lag, no
// spring and no collision. The robot's body IS the camera boom.
//
// THE AXES, read off the MJCF's `xyaxes` and confirmed against the compiled
// model (`model.cam_quat[d435i]` = (-0.5, -0.5, 0.5, 0.5) wxyz):
//
//     camera right (+x)  = torso -y      (a robot facing +x has its right at -y)
//     camera up    (+y)  = torso +z
//     camera back  (+z)  = torso -x      so it LOOKS along torso +x
//
// LOOKING AROUND IS CAMERA-ONLY. Nothing here is sent anywhere: the drag turns
// the picture, never the robot. The policy owns the waist joints, and a browser
// that could write to them would be driving the thing the RL policy is being
// judged on. What the clamps borrow from the waist is only its RANGE, because
// that is how far a real G1 could turn its eyes:
//
//     waist_yaw_joint    range="-2.618 2.618"   = +/- 150.00 deg
//     waist_pitch_joint  range="-0.52  0.52"    = +/-  29.79 deg
//     waist_roll_joint   range="-0.52  0.52"    ignored -- a rolled horizon is
//                                               nausea, not information
//
// SIGNS MATCH THE THIRD-PERSON CAMERA, deliberately, so one drag habit works in
// both views. There, `movementX` adds to the MuJoCo azimuth (where the camera
// SITS) and the viewing direction is azimuth + 180, so a rightward drag swings
// the view counterclockwise; `movementY` adds to elevation, and elevation is
// NEGATIVE when the camera is above looking down, so a downward drag tilts the
// view up. Both are "drag the world", which is what the 2-D page and MuJoCo's
// own viewer do. Same two degrees-per-pixel constants, same feel.
//
// NO AUTO-RECENTRE (the call, stated because the third-person camera does the
// opposite). There, the boom drifts back behind the robot after two idle
// seconds because a chase camera that does not is a chase camera you have to
// keep steering. Here the offset IS the head turn: a climber who looks left and
// keeps walking is still looking left, and having the view creep forward on its
// own while you watch something is the worse surprise. R -- which already
// recentres the third-person boom -- zeroes this offset too.
