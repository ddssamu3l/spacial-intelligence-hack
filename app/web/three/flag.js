// A red pennant on a pole on top of the G1's head -- and on the hiker's -- to
// show the wind.
//
// WHAT IT IS FOR. The 3-D page already knows the wind -- the snow drifts with
// it and the sidebar prints it -- but neither tells you at a glance which way it
// blows on the mountain the robot is standing on. A flag does: it points
// DOWNWIND, it lifts from hanging limp to flying level as the wind gets up, and
// it ripples faster and harder the harder it blows. Red because everything else
// in frame is snow.
//
// IT IS DECORATION AND NOTHING ELSE. Nothing here reaches the simulator. There
// is no MuJoCo body, no mocap slot, no geom, no mass and no collision shape --
// the flag is a Three.js Group parented to the head's node in the GLB, built and
// animated entirely in the browser, and the pose stream it rides on is
// read-only. So the physics parity question does not arise: the model the
// solver integrates is byte for byte the model it integrated before this file
// existed, because this file cannot write to it.
//
// WHERE IT SITS. The G1 has no head BODY -- `head_link` is a GEOM hanging off
// `torso_link`, and so are the `d435i` camera and the `mid360` lidar site. So
// the mount is an offset in `torso_link`'s frame (the sidecar names that body as
// `torso_body`), taken from the lidar site's own height of 0.456 m with a
// centimetre and a half of clearance. Because the pole is parented to that node
// it TILTS WITH THE ROBOT, which is what a pole bolted to a head does -- while
// the cloth is counter-rotated back into the world frame every frame, because
// the wind does not care which way the robot is facing.
//
// TWO OF THEM (user's ruling, 2026-08-30). The same class, the same size and
// the same cloth flies on the HIKER's head too, so the wind reads off both
// figures in the same frame. Her mount is an offset in the `guide` mocap body's
// frame -- see `HIKER_MOUNT_IN_BODY` -- and it needs no visibility rule of its
// own: when the guide knob is off, `guide.py` parks that whole body at
// z = -50 m and the flag rides down with it, because it is a CHILD of the node.
//
// THREE TIMES THE SIZE, and the clearance re-checked rather than assumed (user's
// ruling, 2026-08-30: "the flag needs to be a lot bigger"). The mount is 7.5 cm
// BEHIND the `d435i` camera's own plane and 8.5 cm above it. That camera looks
// along +x with a 58 deg vertical field of view, which on the eyes' 320x240
// frame is a 36.5 deg half width and a 42.7 deg half DIAGONAL. Measured off the
// COMPILED model (`model.cam_pos` / `cam_quat` / `cam_fovy` on flat_0, not off
// the MJCF text): the pole's base sits 131.4 deg off the optical axis and its
// top 98.0 deg -- both still behind the image plane, where no field of view can
// reach. The CLOTH is the part that grew into open air, so it was swept: every
// point on the pennant, over every lift angle 0-90 deg and every wind heading,
// comes no closer than 56.2 deg to the optical axis (worst case: level-ish at
// 34 deg of lift, blowing straight forward). That is 13.5 deg of margin on the
// half diagonal, so a future in-model version of this flag still could not get
// into the robot's eyes.
//
// COST. Two draw calls and 250 triangles PER FLAG against the world's ~780,000
// -- four and 500 now that the hiker wears one -- one small vertex shader, and
// no per-frame allocation: the ripple is entirely a function of `uTime` on the
// GPU, and the JavaScript side writes four uniforms and one quaternion a frame.
//
// EVERYTHING HERE IS Z-UP, like the rest of this directory.
