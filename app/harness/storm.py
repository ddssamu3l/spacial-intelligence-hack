"""VISIBILITY, as the ROBOT experiences it. A WHITE-OUT, not a snow shower.

THE POINT. The 3D page draws the weather. This file is the other half -- what a
white-out does to a machine that navigates by looking. It owns the ROBOT'S EYES;
the page's own fog lives in `app/web/render3d.html` and `three/world.js` and is
driven by the same knob and the same two endpoints, so the two agree.

**VISIBILITY IS ITS OWN DIAL** (user's ruling, 2026-08-30, and it replaced this
file's second version). Until then a `storm` switch turned the weather on and
the thickness came out of the WIND SPEED -- `100 m * exp(-wind / 6)` -- which
made two independent things one control: you could not have a still white-out or
a clear gale, and every wind experiment silently changed what the robot could
see. The knob is now a DISTANCE IN METRES and it is derived from nothing. Wind
still does force, flag, sound and gusting; visibility does only visibility.

**A WHITE-OUT IS FOG** (the earlier user ruling, which stands). The first
version painted dense flakes and wind-blown streaks over the eye images; it read
as particles slapping the lens, which is a windscreen effect, not a mountain.
What a white-out actually does is take DISTANCE away: the far slope dissolves
into white first, then the middle distance, and finally you cannot see the
person three metres in front of you. Everything here is distance-dependent, and
nothing sits on the lens.

  VISIBILITY  v, in metres, straight off the knob. CLEAR_VISIBILITY_METERS
              (100 m) means CLEAR and the eyes are not touched at all; the far
              end of the dial is MINIMUM_VISIBILITY_METERS (3 m), at which only
              the nearest couple of metres are readable.
  THE FOG     composited per pixel from the eye renderer's OWN DEPTH BUFFER:
              `out = colour*(1 - f) + fog_colour*f`, and BOTH halves of that
              are the PAGE'S, not this file's own (user's ruling, 2026-08-30 --
              see "ONE LAW, ONE COLOUR" below).
  SENSOR      mild Gaussian noise per eye, drawn INDEPENDENTLY for the left and
              the right. That is the one thing fog does not reproduce: a real
              pair of cameras staring into a low-contrast white field produces
              two different noise fields, and a block matcher has nothing to
              match. A couple of grey levels, not a texture. It scales with the
              WHITE-OUT SHARE, not with the wind, for the same reason as
              everything else here.

WHY THE FOG IS COMPOSITED AND NOT LEFT TO MuJoCo, which is the whole reason this
file is shaped the way it is. MuJoCo has linear GL fog, and it CANNOT BE MOVED
at runtime from Python. All four of these were measured, not assumed:

  * `model.vis.map.fogstart` / `fogend` are multiples of `model.stat.extent`,
    and `mjr_render(viewport, scene, context)` takes NO MODEL -- it cannot read
    them. Writing them mid-run changes the picture by **0.000**.
  * `context.fogStart` / `fogEnd` are metres and ARE writable from Python, but
    they only reach GL through `glFogf` inside `mjr_makeContext`. Writing them
    mid-run also changes the picture by **0.000**.
  * `mjr_makeContext` is not exposed in the Python bindings, so the context
    cannot be rebuilt to pick them up.
  * `context.fogRGBA` IS read every frame (**14.06** mean pixel change), which
    is exactly the trap: the fog COLOUR is live while the fog DISTANCE is frozen
    at whatever the model compiled with -- 2534 m on `flat_0`, i.e. no fog at
    all. Driving only the colour puts a flat white wash over the whole frame at
    every depth, near objects included. That is the "particles on the glass"
    look arrived at from the other direction, and it is what the first version
    of this file was really doing.

A depth-buffer composite has none of those problems, costs one extra render pass
per eye, and is the same arithmetic GL would have done.

NONE OF THIS IS PHYSICS. Nothing here writes to the model or to `MjData`: the
fog is arithmetic on two rendered arrays. `test_storm` section H is a same-seed
diff with the storm on and off, and it is 0.000e+00.

DETERMINISM. The noise comes from one `numpy.random.Generator` seeded from the
run's `--seed` and advanced once per eye per vision tick, so a replay at the
same seed sees the same grain. Nothing reads the wall clock.

Inputs  : a rendered RGB image and the `mujoco.Renderer` that produced it (its
          scene is still loaded, so the depth pass needs no second
          `update_scene`), plus the visibility in METRES.
Outputs : `StormVision.state()` -- what the page and the recorder are told;
          `degrade(image, renderer)` returns a new image, same shape and dtype.

# ------------------------------------------------- ONE LAW, ONE COLOUR
# (user's ruling, 2026-08-30, and it is what the rest of this section exists
# for.) The eyes and the viewport used to run TWO DIFFERENT fog laws in TWO
# DIFFERENT colours: this file ramped LINEARLY from 0.15*v to v and always
# blended toward a flat white, while the page ran three.js `FogExp2` toward a
# colour that starts as blue-grey haze and only becomes snow-white further down
# the dial. Same knob, two weathers -- the eye picture-in-picture and the 3-D
# view visibly disagreed. The eyes now adopt the PAGE'S law and the PAGE'S
# colour, exactly.
#
# THE FIVE NUMBERS BELOW ARE MIRRORED IN app/web/three/world.js
# (`FOG_EXP2_95_PERCENT`, `FOG_COLOUR`, `FOG_WHITEOUT_COLOUR`,
#  `FOG_WHITENESS_FULL_SHARE`, `FOG_WHITEOUT_EXPOSURE_HEADROOM`). If one moves,
# move the other, or the robot and the picture stop being in the same weather.
# `test_storm` section K prints both laws side by side so a drift shows up as a
# number rather than as a vague feeling that the little window looks wrong.
#
# THE LAW. three.js `FogExp2` is `f = 1 - exp(-(density*d)^2)`, which reaches
# 95% at `d = 1.73 / density`; the page therefore sets `density = 1.73 / v` so
# that "visibility v" means "95% gone at v metres". Substituting:
#
#     f(d) = 1 - exp( -(d * FOG_EXP2_95_PERCENT / v)^2 )
#
# It is SOFT near the lens (quadratic, not linear) and never quite reaches 1,
# which is why the far-depth clamp below still matters.
FOG_EXP2_95_PERCENT = 1.73
# THE COLOUR, and it is a RAMP, not a constant. Clear weather's fog is a cold
# blue-grey haze; a white-out is snow-and-sky white; the page lerps between them

    Outputs : the sRGB triple a screenshot of the viewport would read at full
              fog -- i.e. the colour to blend the eye image toward.

    The page's chain, reproduced step for step:
      1. both endpoints are sRGB hex; three.js `Color` stores them LINEAR.
      2. `lerp` toward the white-out endpoint on
         `whiteness = min(1, share / FOG_WHITENESS_FULL_SHARE)`, in linear light.
      3. `multiplyScalar(1 + (HEADROOM - 1) * whiteness)`, still linear.

    WHY THERE IS NO TONE MAPPING IN HERE, which is the one step a reader expects
    and will not find. In three.js r169 the fog is mixed in AFTER tone mapping
    and after the colour-space encode -- the stock fragment shaders run
    `<tonemapping_fragment>`, `<colorspace_fragment>`, THEN `<fog_fragment>` --
    and the `fogColor` uniform is uploaded already sRGB-encoded
    (`getUnlitUniformColorSpace`). So the ACES curve never touches the fog
    colour; the exposure headroom of step 3 is a straight linear gain that the
    8-bit framebuffer clips. `scene.background` takes the identical path
    (`setClear` -> the same encode), which is why sky and slope agree.

    The visible consequence, and it is the reason this function exists rather
    than a constant: the headroom saturates every channel at a whiteness of
    about 0.33, i.e. a share of 0.22, i.e. **46.7 m of visibility**. Above that
