"""A deterministic, non-learned climbing gait for the G1 on the fixed rope.

The counterpart of `chloe_policy.AscenderController`: same plant, same rope,
same interface, no network. Where her policy is 96 numbers in and 29 numbers
out of an ONNX graph, this is a clock and a table of poses.

WHY A SCRIPT CAN CLIMB HERE AT ALL. The ascender is WELDED (mjEQ_WELD) to the
`rope_carriage`, and the carriage has exactly one degree of freedom: slide
along the rope. So the right wrist is pinned to a straight line in space and
cannot rotate at all -- the robot is holding a rigid rail. With both feet down
that is a three-point support, and a gait that only ever lifts ONE foot while
the other foot and the rail carry the body is quasi-static: nothing has to be
caught, so nothing has to be learned. The rail is also why no balance
controller appears in this file. It is not that balance was solved; it is that
the weld took it away.

THE CYCLE (user's ruling 2026-08-30: "right foot, left foot, right hand slides
up"), each phase a cosine-eased interpolation between joint keyframes:

    1  settle_left    weight onto the left foot, arm braced on the rail
    2  right_step     lift the right foot, swing it uphill, set it down
    3  settle_right   weight onto the right foot
    4  left_step      the mirror
    5  hand_slide     the right arm extends uphill along the rope; because the
                      wrist is welded to it, the CARRIAGE is what moves, and
                      `rope_rail.ratchet` catches it at its new high point
    6  pull           the arm flexes back to the braced pose with both feet
                      planted, which draws the body up under the hand

Phases 1-4 are what actually advances the pelvis; 5-6 advance the rope and add
a second propulsion channel. The carriage would follow the body up on its own
even with a rigid arm (the slide is nearly free: 3 N of cam friction), so the
arm phase is a contribution, not a requirement -- worth knowing before blaming
it for a number.

THE ANKLE IS NEVER A KEYFRAME. On this plant the pelvis stands upright in
world and the GROUND is what tilts, so a sole lies flat on the slope when

    hip_pitch + knee + ankle_pitch = -slope_radians

(verified against the reset pose: -0.312 + 0.669 - 0.712 = -0.355 rad against
a 20 degree slope's -0.349). Every leg keyframe therefore names hip pitch and
knee, and the ankle is SOLVED from them. Writing ankle angles by hand is how a
gait ends up walking on its toes at 30 degrees and its heels at 10.

STOP IS A HELD POSE, AND IT WAITS FOR THE FOOT. `.go = False` freezes the
targets -- but not mid-swing, because a frozen swing leaves a foot in the air
and one support point gone. The phase clock runs on to the next PHASE BOUNDARY
where both feet are planted (the end of `right_step`, `left_step` or `pull`)
and only then freezes. `.go = True` resumes from exactly there. This is the
stop the RL policy cannot offer at all, so it is worth doing properly.

Inputs  : a compiled `mujoco.MjModel` from `chloe_worlds.build` (the rope rail
          present, one actuator per hinge in joint declaration order), the
          `default_joint_positions` regex->radians map `rope_rail.add_rope_rail`
          returned for that build, and an `MjData` per substep.
Outputs : `substep(data)` writes `data.ctrl` -- 29 PD position targets in
          radians, in ACTUATOR order (the joint->actuator permutation is done
          here, as in `AscenderController`). `last_action` is the (29,) target
          vector expressed as a delta from the default pose, in radians, so the
          recorder's `action` column keeps meaning "what the controller asked
          for" on these worlds too. `describe()` is one line for the log.

# ROUND THREE, THE LOAD-TRANSFER LEVER, AND WHY THESE NUMBERS DID NOT MOVE.
# The round-two gait climbs while CROUCHED (pelvis ~0.37 m, torso up-z ~0.41)
# with 140-190 N of rope load per phase -- more than a third of a ~343 N robot
# hanging off its own arm. The obvious fix is to stand it up so the legs carry
# it: raise the stance (KNEE_FLOOR_RADIANS 0.15 / 0.30 / 0.45), drop the
# forward lean (WAIST_PITCH_LEAN 0.08 -> 0.0), then give the taller robot a
# bigger step (HIP_PITCH_SWEEP up to 0.30, foot clearances up to 7 cm),
# 72 configurations at 10 and 20 degrees, rope force measured throughout.
#
# IT WORKS, AND THAT IS THE PROBLEM. Standing tall does exactly what it says:
# rope load falls to 72 N mean / 143 N peak and the robot holds an honest
# upright posture (pelvis 0.613 m, up-z +0.99) -- and it stops climbing
# (-0.11 m at 20 degrees). The correlation across all 72 cells runs the wrong
# way: every cell that climbs hangs at 150-250 N, and every cell under ~100 N
# stands still. On this plant the hanging IS the propulsion -- the weld is what
# lets a skating foot be dragged uphill at all, and unloading it hands the
# slope back a robot that has to walk up under its own friction, which is the
# thing round two established it cannot do.
#
# The one genuinely better 20-degree cell found (sweep 0.22, right clearance
# 7 cm, settle_right 0.4) climbs +0.12 m at 116 N mean -- a real improvement on
# round two's -0.09 m, and the only cell to be positive at 20 degrees AND under
# 150 N. It costs 10 degrees everything: +0.68 m -> -0.14 m. So it is recorded
# here and NOT shipped, per the standing rule that a measured win is not
# allowed to regress a bigger measured win.
#
# What the numbers say the real fix is: not posture, but getting weight onto
# the feet at all -- a shorter rope stand-off, or a gait that presses the soles
# into the slope instead of letting the weld take the reaction.

LEFT_FOOT_CLEARANCE_METERS = 0.020   # a DRAG, not a step -- see below

# WHY THE LEFT FOOT ONLY EVER DRAGS (round two, measured). Round one lifted
# both feet the same 4.5 cm and slid downhill on every slope. Two rounds of
# ablations said why, and the second reason is the real one:
#   * The centre-of-mass story is true but not the binding constraint. The rope
#     hand is welded on the RIGHT (y = -0.24 m), so with the left foot up both
#     supports are on the right of the body. Driving the pelvis over them --
#     weight shifts of 0.20/0.28/0.36 rad, settle phases of 0.7 and 1.2 s, the
#     left foot planted 0.12 rad wider -- did not climb in ANY of 24 cells at
#     20 degrees, and the widened stance was strictly worse.
#   * THE FEET ARE SKATING. Tracing the feet along the slope showed the left
#     foot travelling 0.28 m DOWNHILL in half a second: not a step, a slip. The
#     weld is a rigid 5-DoF constraint that carries most of the weight (266 N
#     of rope force against a ~343 N robot), so the feet are barely loaded and
#     barely have friction, and a foot lifted clear comes down sliding.
# So the left foot never fully unloads: 2 cm of clearance, just enough to break
# static friction and slide uphill, with the weight left where it is. That one
# change is what turned -0.20 m into +0.68 m at 10 degrees.
# THE TWO SHIFTS ARE NOT THE SAME SIZE, because the two steps are not the same
# problem. The rope hand is welded on the RIGHT (y = -0.24 m). Lifting the
# RIGHT foot leaves left-foot + hand straddling the body: an easy support line,
# and a small lean does it. Lifting the LEFT foot leaves right-foot (y = -0.12)
# + hand (y = -0.24) BOTH on the right of the body, so the centre of mass has
# to travel past them or it rolls left -- which is exactly what killed round
# one. Hence a much bigger shift before the left foot leaves, and a longer
# phase to get there.

# THE RIGHT ARM IS ABSENT FROM THIS TABLE ON PURPOSE, and so is every arm

# determines the arm angles, and any PD target that disagrees is a fight the
# constraint solver wins. Measured, the first way round: driving the shoulder
# and elbow through a "reach" keyframe put 1.72 rad of tracking error into
# right_wrist_yaw and dropped the pelvis from 0.67 m to 0.30 m in six seconds.
# The arm now holds the pose `rope_rail.solve_wrist` solved for the rope and
# lets the carriage -- which is nearly free, 3 N of cam friction -- follow the
