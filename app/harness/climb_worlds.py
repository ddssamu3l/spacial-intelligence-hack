"""The merged ClimbScene worlds: G1 + Lhotse terrain + draped rope, in the browser.

`rl/environment/climb_scene.py::build_scene` builds the whole thing -- terrain
heightfield, rope polyline, bead-on-a-wire carrier, grip equality, spawn pose
fitted to the slope. This module calls it and drives it. It builds NOTHING.

The physics step is HIS: `ClimbScene.step(wind)` is one `mj_step` plus the
carrier projection plus the arc-length ratchet, with the wind drag written into
`xfrc_applied` first. We call it ten times per 50 Hz control tick and put our
app layer (W, mouse-look heading, wind dial, friction knob, recorder,
websocket) around it.

THE POLICY IS ALSO HIS. `rl/environment/walk_policy.py::WalkController` is now
the authoritative 103-dim observation builder, and using it rather than our own
removes a whole class of drift. One thing about it is load-bearing and easy to
get wrong:

    default_pose = robot.KNEES_BENT_QPOS[7:36]     NOT the scene's keyframe

On a slope `build_scene` leans the base and pitches the ankles so the soles lie
flat, so the scene's `knees_bent` keyframe is NOT the pose the policy's action
deltas are defined about. Reading `default_pose` off the compiled model -- which
is what our legacy `PlaygroundObservation` does, correctly, for the old flat
`climb_env` -- would silently move the policy's operating point with the
terrain. `app/harness/test_parity.py` measures our builder against his to show
they agree at the same state.

WHAT THIS SCENE DOES NOT HAVE, and what we do instead:

  `upvector_torso` sensor      absent (`robot.adapt` adds only
                               `local_linvel_pelvis` and `gyro_pelvis`). The
                               fall check reads the same quantity straight off
                               `site_xmat[imu_in_torso]` column z -- that IS
                               what a `framezaxis` sensor on that site reports.
  the 7 `..._found` sensors    absent, so the foot/shin self-collision half of
                               Playground's termination cannot be evaluated
                               here. Our fall test is upright < 0 or non-finite
                               state: NARROWER than the training env's. Stated
                               in PARITY.md.
  a rope-off switch            `build_scene` has no such argument, so the free
                               worlds deactivate the `ascender_grip` equality
                               through `data.eq_active` exactly as the legacy
                               worlds do. The carrier still rides the rope; the
                               hand is simply no longer tied to it.

Inputs  : a world name from `CLIMB_WORLD_DEFINITIONS`.
Outputs : `ClimbSceneLibrary.load(name)` -> (scene, meta, definition);
          `ClimbSceneEpisode` presents the same interface `runtime.Episode`
          does, so the control loop in `runtime.run` drives either kind.

# --- the sandbox ---------------------------------------------------------
# The shipped DEM patches are FIXED at 25 x 15 m: `terrain.load_patch` reads a
# whole `.npz` and there is no crop or window argument anywhere in that module.
# So a bigger map cannot come from the DEM without new code, and writing a new
# terrain pipeline was explicitly out of scope.
#
# `terrain.make_terrain(slope_deg, rough_rms, seed, length_m, width_m, res)`
# DOES take an arbitrary size, and builds it from the same octave recipe and
# the same `synth_roughness` the patches use. So the sandbox is big and it is
# the same noise family -- but it is SYNTHETIC, not measured. Nothing about it
# is Lhotse beyond the roughness statistics, and it must never be quoted as
# terrain evidence. (The shipped patches are only measured above ~30 m anyway:
# one 25 x 15 m patch covers 0.447 of a single DEM cell.)
#
# Size chosen by measurement, at 1920x1080 with an idle robot:
#     25 x 15 m  res 0.05   300 x 500   60.9 fps   0.6 MB   (the patch size)
#     60 x 60 m  res 0.10   600 x 600   54.4 fps   1.4 MB
#    120 x 120 m res 0.15   800 x 800   39.0 fps   2.6 MB
#    120 x 120 m res 0.20   600 x 600   48.8 fps   1.4 MB  <- chosen

#    200 x 200 m res 0.30   667 x 667   43.7 fps   1.8 MB
# Physics was 20-29x realtime at EVERY size -- the heightfield never bound the
# solver. Render cost is what buys area, and it tracks the GRID, not the metres:
# 200 x 200 m is affordable only by making cells so coarse (0.30 m) that the
# finest roughness octave (0.6 m correlation) spans two cells and stops being
# resolved. 120 x 120 m at 0.20 m keeps three cells per finest octave, leaves
# ~10 fps of headroom for the graphics pass, and is still 38x the area of a
# patch (14400 m2 against 375).

# --- Ines's uneven terrain at arbitrary slope --------------------------------
# `terrain.load_patch` runs a least-squares DE-PLANE: it returns the patch's
# real micro-roughness as a mean-zero grid (patch B: RMS 0.1138 m) and hands the
# macro tilt to the terrain geom's quaternion. Slope and roughness are therefore
# separable, and a `dataclasses.replace` on the slope field is the SAME
# mechanism the shipped `B_slope*` family uses -- the surface keeps every
# centimetre of the measured 12 cm roughness and only the macro tilt moves.
# Verified: replace(slope_deg=10) leaves `rough` bit-identical to patch B's.
#
# This is used instead of the `B_slope*` files because those only exist at 0,
# 25, 30, 35, 45 and 50 degrees, and each carries its OWN noise seed (roughness
# correlation between B and B_slope25 is -0.06, i.e. unrelated draws). Reusing
# patch B's actual roughness for all six means slope is the only variable that
