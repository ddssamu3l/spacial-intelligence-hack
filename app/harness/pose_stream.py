"""Broadcast every body's world pose once per control tick, as bytes.

THE ONLY THING THE PAGE DRAWS THE WORLD FROM (since the 2-D page was retired,
2026-08-30). The harness used to ship a PICTURE of the scene -- a server-side
chase-camera render, ~40 kB a frame, 2 MB/s at 50 Hz, and 10-20 ms of a 20 ms
control tick -- which the browser could only display. `app/web/render3d.html`
draws the scene itself, so it needs the geometry once
(`app/harness/export_scene.py` writes the GLB) and then only where everything
IS. That is this file: 32 bodies x 7 floats, 916 bytes a tick, 46 kB/s -- one
fiftieth of what the JPEG stream cost, and it buys a camera the server never has
to know about.

THE SEAM. `Episode.physics_step_hooks` is a list of `callable(model, data) ->
dict | None` called after EVERY `mj_step`, i.e. at 500 Hz. A pose per physics
substep would be ten times more than any display can use, so the hook COUNTS
and only broadcasts on the last substep of each control tick -- the same instant
`runtime.run` builds that tick's state message, so the poses and the telemetry
are the same moment of simulation, not neighbouring ones. The hook returns None
always, which is what keeps it out of the `latest_bms` channel that seam also
carries.

                           loaded, so the ~1.6 s a first-time world build takes
                           cannot paint one map's poses onto another's mesh.

                           order. The sidecar's `bodies` array is the key from

                           it is read from `data.contact`, so it is the solver's
                           own answer, not a height threshold guessed in JS.

WHY WORLD FRAME AND NOT JOINT ANGLES. Joint angles would be smaller still (29
floats), but rebuilding world poses from them means reimplementing MuJoCo's
kinematic tree, its joint frames and the free joint in JavaScript -- three
places for the picture to silently disagree with the physics. `data.xpos` is
the answer MuJoCo already computed and the one its own renderer draws.

STALENESS, stated because it is a real one-substep offset: `mj_step` integrates
`qpos` last, so `xpos` trails it by 2 ms. The eye cameras read the same `xpos`
through `mjv_updateScene`, so the picture and the robot's own vision carry
exactly the same offset -- they agree with each other, which is what matters
here.
