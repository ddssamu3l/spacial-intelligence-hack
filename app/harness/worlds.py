"""World catalogue for the harness — the ClimbScene worlds only.

The four legacy `legacy_climb_env` worlds (the old flat tilted plane from
`rl/environment/climb_env.py`) are removed: that env is deleted, and training
now runs on `G1ClimbTerrain` (the same merged terrain). This module now
delegates the world definitions to `climb_worlds` and keeps the names
`runtime.py` has always imported (`WORLD_DEFINITIONS`, `describe_worlds`,
`world_names`, `resolve_world_name`, `ascender_geom_ids`).

The old world *names* (`free_0`, `climb_30`, ...) survive as aliases so
external callers (app/bms_ui's selftest) don't break; `resolve_world_name`
maps them to the closest ClimbScene world.
