"""Chloe's rope-ascender worlds: the plant her policy was trained in.

    Chloe v1 · 20° · rope   chloe_v1_20     (the whole ladder: chloe_v1_{0..40})

These two are the ONLY worlds in the harness where the walking policy does not
fly the robot. Picking one of them loads
`chloe_policy.AscenderController` -- her mjlab-trained network -- and the plant
underneath it is hers too, rebuilt here from plain MuJoCo:

  robot       assets/robots/mujoco/g1_unitree_ascender.xml, its own actuators
              and keyframes DELETED and replaced with mjlab's articulation
              (kp/kd/armature per motor group, `chloe_policy.G1_ARTICULATION`)
  rope        assets/robots/mujoco/rope_rail.py -- ONE straight non-colliding
              line 0.60 m above the ground, an ascender WELDED (mjEQ_WELD) to a
              1-DoF `rope_carriage` slide, and a ratchet that is the slide's
              moving lower limit
  ground      one plane, no roughness, no heightfield
  rates       physics 0.005 s, decimation 4, control 50 Hz

NONE OF THAT IS NEGOTIABLE and none of it is ours. Measured, both directions:
give her policy the harness's walking gains (kp 75 / kd 2) and it falls in
under two seconds; give it a flat 0.5 action scale instead of her per-joint
table and it falls in under two seconds. The usable slope band is 10-30
degrees, and these worlds sit at 20 and 25.

THE FRAME, and why there are two of them
----------------------------------------
She trained on a FLAT plane with GRAVITY TILTED by the slope: world +x is
"uphill" because that is the direction gravity does not pull, and the robot's
spawn attitude is a rotation about +y by the slope angle, which puts its
projected gravity at exactly (0, 0, -1). That is `frame="tilted_gravity"`, and
it reproduces `rl/scripts/sim2sim.py` exactly.

It also LOOKS wrong: on the 3-D page the ground is level, the rope is
horizontal, the robot leans 20 degrees backwards, and "height gained" reads
0.00 m forever while the robot visibly climbs nothing.

So the shipped worlds use `frame="tilted_plane"`: the WHOLE WORLD -- floor,
rope, carriage, robot -- rigidly rotated by -slope about +y, and gravity put
back to (0, 0, -9.81). This is a change of coordinates and nothing else, and
every quantity the policy reads is invariant under it:

    pelvis angular velocity   qvel[3:6] is already in the BODY frame
    projected gravity         R(q_R q)^T (R g) = R(q)^T g
    joint angles / velocities  untouched by a world rotation
    carriage - pelvis, in the pelvis frame   same cancellation

The weld and the slide survive it for free: the carriage BODY is rotated with
everything else, so the weld's relative pose (expressed in the carriage frame)
and the slide's axis (expressed in the carriage frame) are unchanged numbers.
Only floating-point rounding differs, and `python -m app.harness.chloe_worlds
--equivalence` runs both frames and prints both 15-second numbers so the claim
is measured rather than asserted.

WHAT THE PAGE GETS OUT OF IT: a slope that rises, a rope that climbs it, a
robot standing upright on it, honest metres of height gained, and the snow /
sky / flag / hiker / storm layers working exactly as they do on the Lhotse
worlds.

STOP AND GO (user's ruling 2026-08-30). Her network has no command input, so
W does not steer -- it gates. W held runs the network; W released freezes the
PD targets where the policy left them and lets the ratchet hold the body on
the line. A and D and the mouse heading do nothing at all on these worlds, and
the guide follower, when it is on, may drive the same go/stop gate but can
never steer. See `chloe_policy.AscenderController.go`.

Inputs  : a world name from `CHLOE_WORLD_DEFINITIONS`.
Outputs : `ChloeSceneLibrary.load(name)` -> (scene, meta, definition);
          `ChloeAscenderEpisode` presents the interface `runtime.run` drives --
          `step(command, wind)` -> a row dict, `reset()`, the same attributes
          `ClimbSceneEpisode` carries.
