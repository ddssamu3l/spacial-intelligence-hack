"""The robot's EARS: four virtual microphones, three detectors, one behaviour.

THE FEATURE. A person shouts at the robot. The robot works out (a) that a human
voice is there, (b) whether the word was "stop", and (c) which way the sound
came from -- and then it COMES TO HER. If its eyes can see her, the stereo
follower already knows how to walk to a person, so vision drives. If they
cannot, the ear bearing drives until they can.

THE HONESTY LINE, and it is exactly the one `guide.StereoEyes` draws. The eyes
take the simulator's TRUTH geometry, render it into two pictures, and then
measure a distance from the PICTURES. The ears do the same trick with sound:

    the MICROPHONE signal is real           -- it is the human's actual voice,
                                               captured by the Mac's microphone
                                               in the browser and streamed here
                                               as 16 kHz mono PCM. Nothing
                                               about the WORDS is simulated.
    the EAR signals are SYNTHESISED from truth positions. The voice is emitted
                                               at the hiker's mouth (a point on
                                               the guide's head, which the
                                               simulator knows) and propagated
                                               to four points on the robot's
                                               head (which the simulator also
                                               knows): 1/r gain, a propagation
                                               delay, a gentle air-absorption
                                               low-pass, and wind noise.
    every DECISION reads only the four ear signals. Nothing downstream of
                                               `EarArray.feed` ever touches
                                               `MjData` again. The bearing is
                                               recovered by cross-correlating
                                               the four channels, exactly as a
                                               real mic array would, and it is
                                               wrong in the ways a real mic
                                               array is wrong.

The truth positions are the sensor MODEL's input, the way the renderer's scene
graph is the eyes' input. What is a LABELLED CHEAT and what is not is therefore
the same distinction the eyes make, and `PARITY.md` carries the ledger.

FIVE PIECES, kept apart so each can be replaced on its own:

    EarArray        truth geometry + one mono source -> four ear channels.
                    Propagation only: delays, gains, one low-pass per mic.
    WindNoise       the noise floor, as a function of the wind dial. Drawn
                    INDEPENDENTLY per mic, because a mic array's whole ability
                    to hear a direction rests on its channels being different,
                    and correlated noise would leave the bearing untouched by
                    a gale, which is a lie.
    VoiceActivity   webrtcvad on 30 ms frames -> "a human voice is present",
                    reported as the voiced-frame share of a rolling window.
    StopWord        Vosk small English with a grammar of exactly
                    `["stop", "[unk]"]` -> a confidence for the word `stop`.
    Bearing         GCC-PHAT between the front/back and the left/right pairs
                    -> an azimuth in the ROBOT'S BODY frame, and a confidence
                    from the correlation peak's sharpness.

Then `HearingBehaviour`, which is the layer on top of `guide.GuideFollower`,
and `HearingSystem`, which is what `runtime.run` holds.

WHY webrtcvad AND NOT SILERO. Silero VAD is a torch model, and this venv has no
torch (it is a JAX/brax environment). Pulling ~250 MB of torch into a 50 Hz
control loop to answer a yes/no question that a 158 kB C library answers in
40 microseconds is the wrong trade for a demo that must run on a laptop next to
MuJoCo. webrtcvad is Google's WebRTC voice-activity detector, it is what a
telephony stack actually ships, and its per-frame verdict is binary -- so the
"probability" this module reports is the VOICED-FRAME SHARE of the rolling
window, which is an honest number rather than a made-up confidence.

Inputs  : `MjData` each tick (truth positions only), and a mono int16 PCM
          stream at `SAMPLE_RATE_HZ` from the page's microphone.
Outputs : `HearingSystem.state()` (the websocket block), `.recorded()` (the
          episode columns), `.command(...)` (the (3,) walking command), and
          `.take_ear_pcm()` (the `EAR0` monitor mix).

#                            + WIND_NOISE_AT_REFERENCE
#                              * (speed / WIND_NOISE_REFERENCE_MPS) ** 2
#
# QUADRATIC, because wind noise on a bare capsule is turbulent pressure on the
# diaphragm and turbulent pressure goes as the dynamic head, rho*U^2/2. It is
# not the aerodynamic drag law of `wind_env.py` reused by coincidence; it is the
# same physics arriving at the same exponent.
#
# THE ANCHOR, and it is the one number in this file that is a judgement call: a
# 20 m/s gale on an UNWINDSHIELDED microphone sits about 10 dB below a VOICE AT
# ONE METRE. A foam windshield would be worth another 15-20 dB and this robot is
# not wearing one.
#
# BOTH SIDES OF THAT COMPARISON ARE RMS, and getting that wrong is how this file
# was first written: the anchor was applied to the corpus's PEAK level instead
# of its rms, which is 15.6 dB higher, and the whole grid collapsed -- a 6 m/s
# breeze wiped out a shout at two metres and every table below 0 m/s read 0.0%.
# So the voice's reference level is stated explicitly and MEASURED:
# `VOICE_REFERENCE_RMS_AT_ONE_METER` is the median rms of a `say` utterance at
# unity gain, and `test_hearing` prints the corpus's own measured median beside
# it so a drift shows up rather than hiding.

    independent wind noise. The delay and the gain are LINEARLY INTERPOLATED

class Bearing:
    """GCC-PHAT across two microphone pairs -> an azimuth in the BODY frame.

    THE ARITHMETIC, and it is the whole reason there are four mics and not two.
    For a source far enough away that the wavefront is flat, the arrival time at
    a microphone at body-frame position `p` is `(R - p.u) / c`, where `u` is the
    unit vector from the robot TOWARD the source. So for an opposed pair,

        tau_ij = t_i - t_j = -(p_i - p_j) . u / c

    Front/back gives `u_x`, left/right gives `u_y`, and the azimuth is
    `atan2(u_y, u_x)`. A SINGLE pair gives one component and therefore a
    front/back (or left/right) ambiguity; two opposed pairs give both components
    and there is no ambiguity left to resolve. Positive = the source is to the
    robot's LEFT, the same sign `guide.StereoEyes` uses and the same sign
    `ang_vel_yaw` wants.

    SUB-SAMPLE OR NOTHING. The 14 cm baseline is 6.8 samples end to end at
    16 kHz, so the correlation peak is interpolated by zero-padding the inverse
    transform `BEARING_INTERPOLATION_FACTOR` times -- the standard GCC-PHAT
    refinement -- which takes the lag resolution to 1/8 sample and the angular
    resolution near broadside to under a degree. Rounded to whole samples the
    array could only ever report about fifteen distinct angles.

    CONFIDENCE is the peak's SHARPNESS: the correlation maximum divided by the
    rms of the correlation over the physically possible lag range, mapped onto
    [0, 1]. A clean utterance gives a single tall spike; a gale gives a lumpy
    field with no spike, and the ratio falls to about 1. It is a measure of
    "is there one direction here", which is exactly the question, and it is not
    a probability of anything.

    THE RULES, and they are the user's, verbatim in behaviour:

      * a confident `stop` -> `STOPPED`. The robot stands, and stays stopped.
      * any OTHER human voice -> the robot COMES TO HER. If the eyes can see
        her, the existing FOLLOW/WAIT does the navigation and stops at 1 m
        (`COMING_BY_EYES`). If they cannot, the ear bearing does
        (`COMING_BY_EARS`), re-estimated on every new utterance, until the eyes
        acquire and vision takes over.
      * VOICE IS A TRIGGER, NOT A LEASH. One shout starts the walk; silence does
        not stop it. It ends at the person (`WAIT`) or at a `stop`.
      * LOSING HER MID-WALK IS NOT A SEARCH ANY MORE (user's ruling,
        2026-08-30). The follower's camera sweep is deleted. Called, with no
        eyes on her and no ear cue worth steering by, the robot STANDS STILL AND
        LISTENS (`LISTENING`) -- and the next shout hands it a direction, which
        is a thing a camera sweep could never do. That is the whole argument for
        ears: a lost robot should wait to be called, not wave its torso about.

    WHY IDLE AND LISTENING BOTH COMMAND ZERO, and why they are still two states.
    `IDLE` is "nobody has called me yet"; `LISTENING` is "I was called, I have
    lost her, and I do not know which way to go". The command is the same and
    the situation is not, and a demo in which those two look identical is a demo
    nobody can read.

    With hearing OFF this class is never consulted and the guide follower's
    command goes through untouched.
