"""The alpine look: fog, a low sun, snow, shadows. Visual only.

WHO READS THIS NOW (2026-08-30, when the 2-D page and its server-side chase
render were retired). This module was written to dress the offscreen
third-person render that fed `app/web/index.html`. That render is gone --
`app/web/render3d.html` draws the scene itself in three.js -- but the module is
NOT dead, because the same `MjModel` is what the ROBOT'S EYE CAMERAS render
through (`guide.StereoEyes`). Everything below is therefore in the loop of a
MEASUREMENT, not of a picture:

  `apply_alpine_look`  the sun direction and shadow settings, the headlight,
                       the fog/haze distances and colours, and the snow tint on
                       the terrain geom. The eyes see all of it, and the guide
                       is DETECTED by thresholding orange-red in HSV -- so the
                       lighting is what decides whether the detector fires.
  `add_skybox`         without a skybox texture `mjRND_SKYBOX` draws BLACK, and
                       every eye pixel above the horizon would be black.
  `apply_render_flags`  `StereoEyes` calls it with `shadows=False`; it is what
                       turns fog, haze and the sky on for the eye render.

Also read by `test_guide.py`, `test_storm.py`, `guide_walk_sheet.py` (which
makes its own renderer) and `export_scene.py` (which bakes the look into the
GLB the 3-D page loads). What DID go with the chase render is
`shadows_affordable` / `SHADOW_MAXIMUM_WIDTH_PIXELS` -- a rule for how wide a
frame could still afford a shadow pass, with no frame left to apply it to.

NOTHING HERE TOUCHES PHYSICS. Every field written is either in `model.vis`
(MuJoCo's visualisation block), `model.geom_rgba` / `model.mat_*` (appearance),
`model.light_*` (illumination), or a render-time flag on `renderer.scene.flags`.
None of them is read by the solver. The parity story is unchanged and PARITY.md
says so; if that ever stops being true, this module is the first suspect and
`describe()` prints every value it set.

WHAT IS AND IS NOT POSSIBLE ON A COMPILED MODEL

A skybox is a TEXTURE, and textures are fixed at COMPILE time -- the merged
scene compiles with `ntex 2`, both `mjTEXTURE_2D` (the Everest logo and the
ascender's basecolour). Without a skybox texture `mjRND_SKYBOX` does nothing
and the background renders BLACK, which is what the first attempt here looked
like.

`build_scene` hands back `scene.spec`, so the texture can be added there and
the spec recompiled. That produces a new `MjModel`, which sounds like it would
invalidate every cached id -- but a texture is an ASSET, not structure, and
adding one moves nothing the physics or this harness addresses. MEASURED, not
assumed: all 14 structural fields (`nq nv nu nbody njnt neq ngeom nsite nsensor
nkey`, `jnt_qposadr`, `jnt_dofadr`, `body_mass`, actuator targets) come back
bit-identical, with only `ntex` changing 2 -> 3. `add_skybox` re-checks that
list every time and REFUSES to swap the model in if anything moved, so the day
this stops being true it fails loudly instead of silently corrupting a run.

Inputs  : the compiled `MjModel`, and the terrain size so fog distances are
          scaled to the map rather than hard-coded.
Outputs : mutates the model in place; `describe()` returns what it set.
