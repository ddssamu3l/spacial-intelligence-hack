"""The interactive walker harness, running the TEAM's climbing environment.

THE ONLY FRONT END IS app/web/render3d.html (user's ruling, 2026-08-30). This
loop SIMULATES and BROADCASTS NUMBERS; it renders no picture of the scene at
all. What goes out is the `POS0` pose stream (`pose_stream.py`, ~1.1 kB a tick),
the state JSON, and -- while the guide is on -- the `EYE0` JPEG of the robot's
own left eye, which is a SENSOR readout and not a view of the world. The
third-person picture is drawn in the browser in three.js from the poses. What
was deleted with the 2-D page: the per-tick offscreen chase-camera render, its
raw-JPEG websocket frame, the browser-viewport resize negotiation and
`episode.mp4`. That render cost 10-20 ms of a 20 ms control tick.

Two layers, kept strictly apart:

THEIR STEP SEMANTICS (never re-derived; see team_env.py and PARITY.md)
    command (3,)                     -> the joystick command their obs carries
    observation = 103-d `state`      -> playground_policy.PlaygroundObservation
    action = policy(observation)     -> 29 raw values
    ctrl = default_pose + 0.5*action -> climb_env.py:359
    10 x (mj_step + ascender ratchet)-> climb_env.py:268-285
    phase += 2*pi*dt*gait_freq       -> climb_env.py:388-389
    fall = _get_termination          -> joystick.py:426-442
  No `mj_forward` between the substeps and the next observation: their MJX
  `step` reads sensors that are one substep stale, and so do we.

OUR APP LAYER (the demo; none of it exists on their side)
    W held            -> command lin_vel_x = 0.5 m/s (their lin_vel_x range is
                         [-1, 1], so this is a deliberate half-speed demo pace).
    mouse-look        -> HeadingController turns the robot toward the camera
                         heading with command ang_vel_yaw. NOTE: the right palm
                         is point-attached to a fixed line, so yaw authority is
                         genuinely limited -- the robot will fight the rope
                         rather than spin freely. That is the physics, not a bug.
    wind dial         -> the quadratic drag law from rl/environment/wind_env.py,
                         applied to the torso body's xfrc_applied. THE CLIMB ENV
                         HAS NO WIND: the dial is a demo affordance and every
                         state message says so with `wind_in_training: false`.
    friction slider   -> foot geom mu, live. Training pins it at
                         climb_config.foot_friction (0.8).
    reset / pause / recorder / pose stream / websocket.

Rates. Their model compiles at a 2 ms timestep, so physics is 500 Hz and one
control tick is 10 substeps at 50 Hz -- the ctrl_dt 0.02 / sim_dt 0.002 pair
their config declares. Live mode paces itself against the wall clock and prints
a realtime factor; a `--duration` run goes as fast as it can.
