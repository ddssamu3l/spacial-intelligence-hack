"""Websocket bridge between the runtime and app/web/render3d.html (live mode).

Copied from pemba_bench/bench/server.py and adapted to this repo: the static
root is the REPOSITORY root (so the page lives at
http://<host>:<port+1>/app/web/render3d.html -- and at `/` as well -- and the
episode data at /app/harness/episodes/...), the world list is a single generated
entry for the team environment, and the two directory listings the page used to
scrape are now explicit JSON endpoints.

THE SERVER SENDS NO PICTURE OF THE SCENE (user's ruling, 2026-08-30, when the
2-D page was retired). It used to push a JPEG of a server-side chase-camera
render every control tick; the page draws the scene itself in three.js from the
pose stream, so that render and its frame are gone.

In  (binary)  : the 4 ASCII bytes `MIC0` followed by 16 kHz mono int16
                little-endian PCM -- the Mac microphone, captured by the page
                and streamed straight here with NO browser-side processing. The
                runtime turns it into what four microphones on the robot's head
                would have received (app/harness/hearing.py). Any other binary
                frame is dropped without being decoded.
Out (binary)  : `POS0` then every body's world pose, once per control tick --
                app/harness/pose_stream.py owns the layout, and this is what the
                3-D view is drawn from.
                PLUS, while the guide is on and at the vision rate (10 Hz): the
                4 ASCII bytes `EYE0` followed by a JPEG of the robot's LEFT EYE
                (320x240, quality 70) with the detection box and
                "2.4 m . FOLLOW" drawn on it. That one is a SENSOR readout, not
                a view of the world. The two are told apart by their first four
                bytes.
                PLUS, while the `ear_monitor` knob is on: `EAR0` followed by
                16 kHz mono int16 PCM of the FRONT microphone's own signal --
                the voice as the robot hears it, wind noise and all.

                    keys holds "w" while the key is down; W is the only key. The
                    camera is a third-person orbit around the pelvis, MuJoCo's own
                    azimuth/elevation convention, defaults 180 / -15. The camera's
                    viewing direction is ALSO the steering input: the robot turns
                    to face it, W walks (climbs) that way. Only the AZIMUTH is
                    read now -- elevation moves the browser's own camera.
                    An older client may also send a `viewport` field, which the
                    server-side render used to size itself from. It is accepted
                    and ignored; nothing here draws.
                {"type":"knob", "name":"wind_x"|"wind_y"|"friction"|"guide"|"visibility", "value":f}
                    wind_x / wind_y are the world-frame XY WIND VELOCITY in m/s
                    (NOT newtons -- the force is the quadratic drag law from
                    rl/environment/wind_env.py). friction is the foot geoms' mu.
                    guide is 0/1: with it on, W walks the HUMAN GUIDE along the
                    rope and the robot's command comes from the stereo follower
                    instead of the keyboard (A/D do nothing; the follower owns
                    yaw). Default 0.
                    visibility is HOW FAR THE ROBOT CAN SEE, IN METRES, and it
                    is derived from nothing (user's ruling, 2026-08-30 -- it
                    replaced a `storm` 0/1 switch whose thickness came out of
                    the wind speed). 100 m is CLEAR and the eye images are not
                    touched at all; 3 m is a white-out. In between, a fog is
                    composited into both eye images from the eye renderer's own
                    depth buffer BEFORE the block matcher, so detection and
                    stereo honestly degrade. Echoed back as `visibility_meters`.
                    Default 100.
                    An older page's `storm` knob is stored and IGNORED rather
                    than rejected: `_handle` writes any knob name into the dict
                    and nothing reads that key any more, so a stale client
                    cannot crash the runtime.
                {"type":"reset"}      respawn at the knees_bent keyframe, ascender
                                      travel back to 0.
                {"type":"pause", "value":true|false}
                {"type":"world", "name":"climb_30"|"free_30"|"free_0"|"climb_0"}
                    switch maps: the runtime finalises the episode, opens that
                    world (building its model on first selection, ~1.6 s warm,
                    then cached) and starts a new episode folder. Unknown names are
                    ignored with a line on stdout. See app/harness/worlds.py.

HTTP: static files from the repository root, plus two generated endpoints so no
listing can go stale -- GET /api/worlds and GET /api/episodes.
