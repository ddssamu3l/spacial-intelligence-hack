"""What a white-out does to the robot's eyes. Run it; read the tables.

    ../.venv_everest/bin/python -m app.harness.test_storm
    ../.venv_everest/bin/python -m app.harness.test_storm --world flat_0

Weather that only looks like weather is a screensaver. These are the numbers
that say the robot is really being blinded, and they are measured the same way
the follower measures: the guide is placed at a known true range, the eyes are
rendered, degraded, matched and detected, and the answer is compared against the
simulator's.

VISIBILITY IS A DISTANCE IN METRES AND IT OWES THE WIND NOTHING (user's ruling,
2026-08-30). Every table below is indexed by VISIBILITY, where it used to be
indexed by wind speed through `100 m * exp(-wind / 6)`. Section J is the row
that says the two are now unrelated.

  E0 THE WHITE-OUT IS BY DISTANCE, near half of the frame against far half.
  E  DETECTION AND STEREO vs VISIBILITY, at two ranges. For each visibility the
     same pose is looked at `--repeats` times, because the sensor grain is
     re-drawn every frame and one frame is an anecdote. Reports how often the
     human was seen at all, and the stereo error over the frames where she was.
  F  MAXIMUM DETECTION RANGE per visibility: the furthest range at which she is
     still seen on more than half the frames, found by walking outward.
  G  A CONTACT SHEET of the left eye at each visibility, written to
     `render3d_shots/storm_eyes.png`, because a table cannot show you that the
     white-out looks like a white-out.
  H  THE PHYSICS CLAIM: clear against a 3 m white-out, same seed, tick for tick.
  I  WHAT THE FOLLOWER DOES ABOUT IT, from its own authority.
  J  VISIBILITY IS NOT WIND. The same measurement at one visibility with the
     wind dial at 0 and at 12 m/s.
  K  ONE LAW, ONE COLOUR. The eyes' fog against the PAGE'S fog, both computed
     from constants READ OUT OF `app/web/three/world.js` at run time, at
     d = 0.25v / 0.5v / v / 2v -- so a number that drifts on one side and not
     the other is a failing row rather than a slow-dawning suspicion.

CLEAR IS A ROW IN EVERY TABLE, and it is not a nearly-clear one: at
`CLEAR_VISIBILITY_METERS` the degradation hook returns the image it was handed,
un-fogged and un-grained, and does not even advance its own generator. If that
row is not identical to a run with no degradation hook at all, the degradation
is leaking.

A WHITE-OUT IS FOG, not a snow shower: everything it does is distance-dependent,
so the numbers to read are the RANGES, not the picture's texture.

def visibility_is_not_wind(scene, episode, repeats, world) -> dict:
    """J: the wind dial cannot move the visibility. -> two identical arms.

    THE CLAIM THIS REPLACES. Until 2026-08-30 the visibility WAS the wind speed:
    `100 m * exp(-wind / 6)`, so 0 m/s meant 100 m and 12 m/s meant 13.5 m, and
    no experiment could change one without changing the other. The user split
    them, and this is the table that says the split is real rather than
    cosmetic.

    Two arms, both at `WIND_INDEPENDENCE_VISIBILITY_METERS`, one with the wind
    dial at 0 m/s and one at 12. Under the old coupling those two rows could not
    have agreed on anything.

    J1 is the PICTURE: the same rendered eye image degraded in each arm, and the
       largest per-pixel difference between the two results. It is zero because
       `StormVision.degrade` never sees a wind speed -- which is checked
       directly, by counting the parameters of `StormVision.update`.
    J2 is the BEHAVIOUR: the full detection cell at 2 m and 5 m and the maximum
       detection range, per arm.

    Inputs  : a built scene and its episode; `repeats` frames per cell.
    Outputs : {"parameters", "pixel_difference", "arms": [{...}, ...]} -- the
              per-arm detection rates, median relative errors and max range.
